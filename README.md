This application is based on Create react app template and will search twitter feed and save it on the local storage with drag & drop.

API was provided by the instruction thus no Auth was implemented.

## Things to improve

A couple of things were left out due to the time constraint and purpose of the exercise.

- Redux could make a better data management store.
- SQL or NoSQL like DB will make a more reliable data management source as it currently only uses localStorage.
- Styles were implemented with Semantic UI CSS and simple SCSS compiler due to the nature of the drag & drop library, but typically I would use styled-components for unified styling.
